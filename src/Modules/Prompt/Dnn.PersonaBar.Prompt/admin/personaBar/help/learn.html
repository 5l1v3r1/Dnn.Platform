  <h3>Understanding Prompt Commands</h3>
  <p>
    As with most command line interfaces, the more commands you memorize, the more efficient you can be. Understanding the reasoning behind <em>how</em> Prompt commands are named and structured will make it much easier to learn and internalize them.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Prompt is Case-Insensitive</strong>. That means you can use lowercase, uppercase or mixed-case command names and option flag names. This is typical of most command lines and we find it makes it easier to use on a daily basis.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Commands are either 1 word or 2 words separated by a single dash (-) and no spaces</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>One-Word Commands:</strong> These are generally reserved for commands that interact with the Prompt console itself or the browser. In other words, most of these commands take place in the browser. Some examples are: <code>cls</code> which clears the console screen and <code>reload</code> which tells the browser to reload the page. There are also two-word commands that operate on the client side such as <code>clear-history</code> (though there is a shortcut for clear-history: <code>clh</code></li>
    <li>
      <strong>Two-Word Commands:</strong> These commands follow the format <code>action-component</code>&mdash;an action followed by a single dash followed by a component or object that the action operates on.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h4>Common Actions</h4>
  <p>This is not a complete list of all actions but covers most of them...</p>

  <table class="table">
    <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Action</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td class="mono">list</td>
      <td>
        Retrieves a list of objects. The assumption is that two or more objects will be returned so the component portion of the command is plural:<br>
        <code>list-pages</code> NOT <code>list-page</code>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="mono">get</td>
      <td>
        Will retrieve a single object. If the command results in multiple objects, only the fist object found will be retrieved. Since this command operates on a single item, the component is singular and not plural:<br>
        <code>get-page</code> NOT <code>get-pages</code>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="mono">new</td>
      <td>
        Creates a new object. We chose the word <code>new</code> since it requires less typing than 'create' and it is a more accurate than 'add', which connotes adding something to something else.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="mono">add</td>
      <td>
        Adds something to something else. This should not be confused with <code>new</code> which <em>creates</em> a new object. Consider <code>add-roles</code> and <code>new-role</code>. The former is used to <em>add</em> one or more security roles to a user (i.e. add a role to the list of roles the user already has), whereas the latter command creates a new security role in the DNN system.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="mono">set</td>
      <td>
        Modifies an object. This could mean 'update' or set (for the first time) a value. We chose the word 'set' not only because it's short and easy to type, but also because it is more accurate in more scenarios. 'Update' implies you are changing a value that has already been set, but is less accurate if you are setting a value for the first time. And did we mention 'set' is half the length of 'update'?
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="mono">delete</td>
      <td>
        Deletes an object. The results of this action are contextually dependent. If DNN provides a recycle bin facility like it does for pages and users, then the command will send the object to that recycle bin, allowing it to be restored later. If there is no such facility provided, then the object would be permanently deleted
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="mono">restore</td>
      <td>
        If an object has been previously deleted and DNN provides a recycle facility for the object, then this will restore the object.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="mono">purge</td>
      <td>
        If the object has been previously deleted and DNN provides a recycle facility for the object, then this command will permanently delete the object. The DNN user interface typically refers to this as 'remove' however we felt that 'purge' more accurately reflected the action.
      </td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <h4>Common Components</h4>
  <p>Most components should be familiar to any user with admin experience with DNN. Below are the most common:</p>
  <p>A Note on Plural vs Singular Components:  Whenever a command can 1 or more items, the component will be plural. <code>list-modules</code>, for instance. When the command is designed to return a single object or the first object, then the component will be singular as in <code>get-module</code></p>

  <table class="table">
    <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Component</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td class="mono">user/users</td>
      <td>
        A DNN User
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="mono">page/pages</td>
      <td>A page in the site. NOTE: For historical reasons, DNN refers to pages <em>internally</em> as Tabs while the DNN user interface refers to them as pages. We've chosen to use 'page', but you may see references to Tab or TabID returned from page-related commands. For Prompt's purposes, you should only use 'page' but understand that 'page and 'tab' are synonymous. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="mono">role/roles</td>
      <td>A DNN Security Role</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="mono">task/tasks</td>
      <td>A task is a DNN Scheduler Item or Scheduled Task. We use the word task due to its brevity.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="mono">portal/portals</td>
      <td>A DNN site or portal</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="mono">module/modules</td>
      <td>A DNN module. Depending on the command, this could be a module definition or module instance.</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <h3>Basic Syntax</h3>
  <p>
    <em>Prompt</em> functions in a way similar to a Terminal, Bash shell, Windows CMD shell, or Powershell. You enter a command and hit <code>ENTER</code> and the computer responds with a result. For very simple commands like <code>help</code> or <code>list-modules</code>, that's all you need. Some commands, though, may require additional data or they may allow you to provide additional options.
  </p>
  <p>
    Specifying a target or context for a command: For commands that operate on an object like a user, or that require a context like a page, you simply provide that information after the command. For example, to find the user <em>jsmith</em> using the <code>get-user</code> command, you would type: <code>get-user jsmith</code> followed by the <code>ENTER</code> key to submit it. If you will be specifying flags (see next paragraph), those should <em>always come after</em> the target/context of the command.
  </p>
  <p>
    Specifying Options to Commands: Some commands require even more data or allow you to specify optional configuration information. In <em>Prompt</em> we call these &quot;flags&quot;. These should come <em>after</em> any target/context needed by the command (see above paragraph) and <em>must</em> be preceded with two hyphens or dashes (<code>--</code>). There should be no spaces between the dashes and there should be no space between the dashes and the name of the flag. If then flag requires a value, you add that after the flag.
  </p>
  <p>
    As an example of using flags, take the <code>get-user</code> command. By default, you would specify the username of the user you want to find. However, you can also search by their email address. In that case, you would use the <code>--email</code> flag. Here's how you would use it:
  </p>
  <code class="block">
    get-user --email jsmith@sample.com
  </code>
  <p>
    If the value of a flag is more than one word, enclose it in double quotes like so:
  </p>
  <code class="block">
    set-page --title "My Page"
  </code>
